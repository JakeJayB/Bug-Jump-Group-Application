# Bug Jump
Bug Jump is a 2D platformer game starring a prey mantis. The prey mantis must find food for its family. But, to get food, the prey mantis must overcome many obstacles(hard jumps) and enemies(beatle, flower, worm, and spider).

The prey mantis can obtain a melee/handheld weapon to kill the enemies, and collect colletables(hearts, and stars) to assist them through battle.
Atleast one star is required to complete a level (there are a total of 8 levels)

# What was used to make this game
- Standford's ACM GUI Library
- Personalized level creator: file reader that reads content from a text file and transforms it into a playable GUI level 
- Arraylists to keep track of keyboard inputs
- Hashmaps to pair GUI Images (keys) to their associate game objects (values) for convenient collison operations. Some hashmaps include enemiesMap, bulletMap, terrainMap, and collectableMap.
- A lot of brain power to syncronize all classes of the game :)

# Template for level Creation
